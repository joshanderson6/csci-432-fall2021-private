# CSCI 432 Project

## Overview

In this project, you will work in a group (of 3-4 students) to create a video to
present one of the following two options:

1. A recent algorithm +1. Here, you will present an algorithm from a "recent"
   conference or journal (note: recent means within the last 15ish years).  You
   will choose the algorithm on your own, and become experts on this algorithm.
   In addition, you will take the paper that they found one step further in the
   plus-one (+1) element of their project.
   
2. Comparison of algorithms. Here, you will choose a problem with at least three
   algorithms (and/or implementations) to compare.  You must implement at least
   one of these algorithms.  The presentation is to present the pros/cons of
   the different algorithms/implementations.

## Deliverables

Although not mandatory, all teams are encouraged to meet with the instructor or
the TA.

* 29 November 2021: Progress report due.  In an up to three page document,
  explain what your group has accomplished so far, what the immediate next steps
  are, and what the course of action is to complete the final project.  By the
  time you submit this deliverable, it is expected that you will have
  communicated with the professor and/or TA either via email or in person or via
  Zoom.
* 6 December 2021: final presentations.  The presentation will be in the form of
  a 5-minute video (min: 4 minutes, max: 6.5 minutes). After presenting the
  video in class, be prepared for a short Q&A.  Two example projects from
  previous years:
    1. [Path Planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skK-3UfcXW0)
    2. [Elastic Pathing Bozeman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXqyQ1_Elss)
* 10 December 2021: A formal write-up summarizing the algorithm that your group
  presented is due, including a description of the problem it solves.  In
  addition,
    1. For those that choose the "recent algorithm +1" option, describe your +1
    option in detail.
    2. For those that choose the "comparison of algorithms" option, please fully
    describe each algorithm/implementation, as well as the comparison
    techniques.
* FINAL: Please submit a 2-3 page document outlining each group member's
  contribution to your group.  This is an individual submission. 
* Please submit all write-ups in both D2L and Gradescope.  For any code written
  for this project, please submit via D2L only.
